# final_year_project
This report presents the design and development of an Arduino-based Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) system for a solar cell-fed DC motor driver. The aim of this project is to optimize the power extraction from solar cells and efficiently drive a DC motor using an MPPT algorithm implemented on an Arduino microcontroller. The MPPT system continuously tracks the maximum power point of the solar cell, allowing for improved efficiency and increased power output. The report discusses the hardware and software implementation of the MPPT system, presents experimental results, and concludes with an evaluation of the system's performance and potential applications.
